# Devmountain Capstone Project MVP


## TRU-ALGEBRA-PY

Idea:
- A web tool for math teachers looking to help students struggling with algebra concepts. 

MVP:
- Teachers and students can create their respective accounts and login
- Teachers create classes which students can search for and join
- Pulling from a library, teachers can assign equations to classes for them to solve (library searchable by difficulty and type)
- Main Feature: Equation Solving
    - Students solve the equations right there on the web app, no pencil or paper required 
    - Undo Button
    - Hint Button
    - Simplify Button (for Combining Like Terms and Distributing)
- Teachers can view student performance data

Nice to Have:
- Students can share their solutions with other students
- Teachers can create custom equations and assign them to classes 
- Users can only sign-up for a teacher account if they receive an invite from a current teacher user.
- A equation builder sandbox for students to practice with
